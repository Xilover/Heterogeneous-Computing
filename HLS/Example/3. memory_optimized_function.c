/*
Key Points:
Function Name: Corrected to memory_optimized_function.
Memory Optimization: The buffer is specified to use BRAM with the #pragma HLS RESOURCE directive.
Input/Output: The function reads from an input stream and writes processed data to an output stream.
This design efficiently utilizes on-chip memory and minimizes off-chip memory access, which is essential for high-performance HLS applications.
