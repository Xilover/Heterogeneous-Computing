### **Lesson 1: Introduction to Digital Logic**

#### **1.1 Overview of Digital Systems**

**Digital systems** use logic gates and binary numbers to represent and process information. In digital electronics, there are only two states: **0** (low) and **1** (high), which make up the **binary number system**. Unlike analog systems, where signals are continuous, digital systems rely on discrete signals.

- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Digital systems process data in binary format.
  - **Logic gates** are the building blocks of digital systems.
  - Digital systems are used in **microprocessors**, **FPGAs**, and **communication systems**.

---

#### **1.2 Basic Logic Gates**

Logic gates perform basic logical operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output. Each gate has a specific truth table that defines its behavior.

##### **1.2.1 AND Gate**  
- **Truth Table**: The output is **1** only when both inputs are **1**.  
  | A | B | Output |
  |---|---|--------|
  | 0 | 0 |   0    |
  | 0 | 1 |   0    |
  | 1 | 0 |   0    |
  | 1 | 1 |   1    |

##### **1.2.2 OR Gate**  
- **Truth Table**: The output is **1** if at least one input is **1**.  
  | A | B | Output |
  |---|---|--------|
  | 0 | 0 |   0    |
  | 0 | 1 |   1    |
  | 1 | 0 |   1    |
  | 1 | 1 |   1    |

##### **1.2.3 NOT Gate**  
- **Truth Table**: The output is the inverse of the input.  
  | A | Output |
  |---|--------|
  | 0 |   1    |
  | 1 |   0    |

#### **1.3 Truth Tables and Boolean Algebra**

A **truth table** defines the output of a logic gate or circuit for every possible combination of inputs. **Boolean algebra** is used to describe the logical operations in a digital system, allowing simplification of complex logic expressions.

##### **1.3.1 Boolean Expressions**
- **AND** is represented as: `A · B` or `A * B`
- **OR** is represented as: `A + B`
- **NOT** is represented as: `A'` or `!A`

##### **1.3.2 Simplifying Boolean Expressions**
Simplifying Boolean expressions reduces the number of logic gates needed, optimizing the design. Simplification techniques include using **Boolean theorems** and **De Morgan’s laws**.

---

#### **1.4 Boolean Algebra Simplification Rules**

- **Identity Law**: `A + 0 = A` and `A · 1 = A`
- **Null Law**: `A + 1 = 1` and `A · 0 = 0`
- **Idempotent Law**: `A + A = A` and `A · A = A`
- **Complement Law**: `A + A' = 1` and `A · A' = 0`

##### **De Morgan’s Theorem**
De Morgan’s theorem allows for the transformation of ANDs into ORs and vice versa.

- `(A · B)' = A' + B'`
- `(A + B)' = A' · B'`

**Example**: Simplify the expression `(A + B)'`:
- According to De Morgan’s theorem: `(A + B)' = A' · B'`

---

#### **1.5 Exercises**

1. **Truth Table Creation**: 
   - Create truth tables for **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, **NAND**, **NOR**, and **XOR** gates.
   - Practice writing Boolean expressions based on these gates.

2. **Boolean Algebra Simplification**: 
   - Simplify the following expression using Boolean algebra:
     \[
     F(A, B, C) = A · (B + C) + A' · B
     \]

### **Lesson 2: Combinational Logic Circuits**

---

#### **2.1 Overview of Combinational Circuits**

**Combinational circuits** are digital circuits where the output depends only on the current inputs, not on any previous inputs (no memory). Common examples include:

- **Multiplexers (MUX)**
- **Demultiplexers (DEMUX)**
- **Encoders**
- **Decoders**
- **Adders and Subtractors**

These circuits are used to perform basic functions such as addition, subtraction, and data routing.

---

#### **2.2 Multiplexers and Demultiplexers**

A **Multiplexer (MUX)** selects one of many input signals and forwards it to a single output. It is controlled by select lines.

- Example: A **2-to-1 MUX** has two inputs, one output, and one control signal.

**Truth Table for 2-to-1 MUX**:

| Select | Input 0 | Input 1 | Output |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
|   0    |    A    |    B    |   A    |
|   1    |    A    |    B    |   B    |

A **Demultiplexer (DEMUX)** works the opposite way—it takes one input signal and routes it to one of the many outputs based on select lines.

---

#### **2.3 Adders: Half-Adder and Full-Adder**

**Adders** are critical for performing arithmetic operations in digital systems.

- **Half-Adder**: Adds two single-bit binary numbers and outputs a sum and carry bit.
  
**Truth Table for Half-Adder**:

| A | B | Sum | Carry |
|---|---|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |   1   |

- **Full-Adder**: Adds three single-bit binary numbers (including a carry bit) and outputs a sum and carry bit.

**Truth Table for Full-Adder**:

| A | B | Cin | Sum | Carry |
|---|---|-----|-----|-------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0  |   0   |
| 0 | 0 |  1  |  1  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |  1  |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |  0  |   1   |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |  1  |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |  0  |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |  0  |   1   |
| 1 | 1 |  1  |  1  |   1   |
