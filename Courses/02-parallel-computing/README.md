# Parallel Computing and Multithreading

## Overview
This course delves into the principles of parallel computing and multithreading, essential for optimizing performance in heterogeneous systems. Students will learn to design and implement parallel algorithms and understand the nuances of concurrent programming.

### Duration: 4 weeks

## Topics Covered
- **Basics of Parallel Computing**
  - Concepts and Terminology
  - Parallel vs. Serial Computing
- **Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing**
  - Thread Management
  - Process Communication
- **Synchronization and Concurrency**
  - Mutexes, Semaphores, and Locks
  - Deadlocks and Race Conditions
- **Parallel Algorithms and Data Structures**
  - Parallel Sorting and Searching
  - Parallel Matrix Operations

## Hands-on Projects
1. **Multithreaded Application in C++**
   - Develop a multithreaded application that performs concurrent data processing.
   - Implement synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.

2. **Parallel Sorting Algorithm**
   - Implement a parallel version of the QuickSort algorithm.
   - Benchmark its performance against the serial version.
