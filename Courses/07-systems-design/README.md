# Heterogeneous Systems Design and Integration

## Overview
This course focuses on designing and integrating heterogeneous computing systems to ensure optimal performance, scalability, and efficiency.

### Duration: 3 weeks

## Topics Covered
- **System Architecture for Heterogeneous Computing**
  - Designing Multi-Architecture Systems
  - Balancing Workloads across CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc.
- **Task Scheduling and Resource Allocation**
  - Dynamic Task Scheduling Techniques
  - Resource Management Strategies
- **Communication Between Heterogeneous Components**
  - Interconnect Technologies (PCIe, NVLink)
  - Data Transfer Optimization
- **Case Studies: High-Performance Computing (HPC) Clusters**
  - Designing HPC Clusters with Heterogeneous Nodes
  - Real-World HPC Applications

## Hands-on Projects
1. **Designing a Multi-GPU System**
   - Create a system architecture that leverages multiple GPUs for parallel processing.
   - Implement and benchmark a compute-intensive application.

2. **Integrating CPU, GPU, and FPGA in an Application**
   - Develop an application that utilizes CPU for general tasks, GPU for parallel computations, and FPGA for specialized processing.
   - Optimize data flow and task distribution across components.
