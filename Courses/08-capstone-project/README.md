# Capstone Project

## Overview
In this final course, you will integrate all the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the curriculum to develop a comprehensive heterogeneous computing project that solves a real-world problem.

### Duration: 4 weeks

## Project Requirements
- **Problem Selection**:
  - Choose a real-world problem that can be addressed using heterogeneous computing (e.g., high-performance data analytics, real-time video processing, energy-efficient smart systems).
  
- **System Design**:
  - Design the system architecture, selecting appropriate hardware components (CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc.).
  - Define communication protocols and data flow between components.

- **Implementation**:
  - Develop and integrate the software components across different architectures.
  - Optimize the system for performance and energy efficiency.

- **Security and Optimization**:
  - Implement security best practices for data protection and system integrity.
  - Profile and optimize the system to eliminate bottlenecks and enhance performance.

- **Documentation and Presentation**:
  - Document the project comprehensively, including design decisions, implementation steps, and performance metrics.
  - Prepare a presentation showcasing the projectâ€™s objectives, methodology, results, and future improvements.

## Project Examples
- **High-Performance Data Analytics Platform**:
  - Develop a data analytics platform that leverages CPU for data ingestion, GPU for processing, and FPGA for real-time analytics.
  
- **Real-Time Video Processing System**:
  - Create a video processing system that uses GPU for frame processing, FPGA for real-time filtering, and CPU for data management.

- **Energy-Efficient Smart Grid Management**:
  - Design a smart grid management system that optimizes energy distribution using heterogeneous computing resources for predictive analytics and real-time control.
