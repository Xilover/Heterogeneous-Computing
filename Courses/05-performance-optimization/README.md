# Performance Optimization and Profiling

## Overview
This course teaches techniques for optimizing and profiling heterogeneous computing applications to achieve maximum performance and efficiency.

### Duration: 3 weeks

## Topics Covered
- **Performance Metrics and Benchmarking**
  - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
  - Benchmarking Tools and Techniques
- **Profiling Tools for CPU, GPU, and FPGA**
  - CPU Profilers (e.g., gprof, Perf)
  - GPU Profilers (e.g., NVIDIA Nsight)
  - FPGA Profilers (e.g., Intel VTune)
- **Bottleneck Identification and Optimization Strategies**
  - Identifying Performance Bottlenecks
  - Code and Hardware Optimization Techniques
- **Energy Efficiency in Heterogeneous Systems**
  - Power Consumption Analysis
  - Techniques for Reducing Energy Usage

## Hands-on Projects
1. **Profiling a CUDA Application**
